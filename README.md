Interacting with the Tool

-What do you want to search for? (e.g., files, webpages, databases, vulnerabilities).
-Do you want to restrict the search to a specific site or domain? (e.g., example.com).

-What keywords are you looking for? (e.g., username, password, admin).
After answering these questions, the tool will generate the corresponding Google search query and prompt you to confirm if you'd like to perform the search. If you choose to proceed, the query will be opened in your default browser.
